What is Exploratory Data Analysis

• Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach to analyze the datasets to summarize their main
characteristics in form of visual methods.
• EDA is nothing but a data exploration technique to understand various aspects of the data.
• The main aim of EDA is to obtain confidence in a data to an extent where we are ready to
engage a machine learning model.
• EDA is important to analyze the data it’s a first steps in data analysis process.
• EDA give a basic idea to understand the data and make sense of the data to figure out the
question you need to ask and find out the best way to manipulate the dataset to get the
answer to your question.
• Exploratory data analysis help us to finding the errors, discovering data, mapping out data
structure, finding out anomalies.
• Exploratory data analysis is important for business process because we are preparing
dataset for deep thorough analysis that will detect you business problem.
• EDA help to build a quick and dirty model, or a baseline model, which can serve as a
comparison against later models that you will build.
